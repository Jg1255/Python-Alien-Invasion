Additional Features

New Wave - By creating a new wave object in the invaders class when a wave is defeated (rather than ending the game),
we were able to add new waves of aliens. We increased the speed of each new wave by making a speed attribute for the alien in wave,
and called its setter (which increased the speed) each time a new wave was created in app.py. This also required a waveswonspeed attribute
to be added to Invaders so that something could be incremented and used for the setter.

Sounds - By assigning attributes to objects of the sound class with audio files, we were able to incorporate sounds into the project.
We used the play() method whenever the required action occurred that would trigger the sound (alien shooting, ship shooting, ship hit).
We also made a mute/unmute key with 'm' and 'u' by creating a variable that determined whether the play() method could be called (if it was true
it could be called, but the m key made it false).
